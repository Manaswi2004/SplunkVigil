## üõ† Troubleshooting
- *500 Internal Server Error?*
  - Check your OpenAI API key and quota.
  - If OpenAI is down or quota is exceeded, the app will use local scoring.
- *Frontend not connecting?*
  - Make sure both backend and frontend are running.
  - The proxy is set in frontend/package.json.
- *Change the port?*
  - Edit PORT in backend/server.js and update the proxy in frontend/package.json if needed.
